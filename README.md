## Introduction
Most of the successful deep neural network architectures are structured, often consisting of elements like convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent neural networks. Recently, graph neural networks have been successfully applied to graph structured data such as point cloud and molecular data. These networks often only consider pairwise dependencies, as they operate on a graph structure. We generalize the graph neural network into a factor graph neural network (FGNN) in order to capture higher order dependencies. The FGNN is defined using two types of modules, the Variable-to-Factor (VF) module and the Factor-to-Variable (FV) module. These modules are combined into a layer, and the layers can be stacked together into an algorithm. We show that the FGNN is able to exactly parameterize the Max-Product Belief Propagation algorithm, which is widely used in finding approximate \map (MAP) assignment of a PGM. Thus, for situations where belief propagation gives best solutions, the FGNN can mimic the belief propagation procedure. This repo provides the code for testing FGNN on synthetic MAP inference problem and point cloud segmentation on real dataset.

## Build the package

Part of the ldpc decoding and encoding are in C++ and thus compiling is required.
We recommand to use the system compilier and to use conda to install dependencies for compiling. To install dependencies, please run:
```shell
conda install cmake pybind11
```

Then please run the following codes for compiling:

```shell
cd lib/data/MNC
cmake .
make
```

## MAP Inference 

### Dataset downloading

Download the generated synthetic dataset from [synthetic_data.tar.bz2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NPMdcQsyI7XRxHfDfa2s3kJPNVyOBW41/view?usp=sharing).
Place the file in the root folder of the repo and run 

``` shell
tar -jxvf synthetic_data.tar.bz2 
```

### Dataset generation

You can generate the dataset using the following commands
```shell
./generate_rpgm_dataset.sh
```

### Training and testing the model 

``` shell
# model with fixed pairwise and higher order potential 
python train_syn_fixed_pw_hop.py

# model with fixed higher order potential but flexible pairwise potential 
python train_syn_pw_factor.py

#model with flexible pairwise and higher order potential 
python train_syn_hop_factor.py
```

## LDPC Decoding


### Dataset generation

You can generate the dataset using the following commands
```shell
./generate_ldpc_dataset.sh
```

### Training and testing the model 

``` shell
python train_ldpc.py --train
```
